                  on my engineering skills in order to find a job(For more details of this part,

                            This is my senior thesis project supervised by Professor Svetlana Lazebnik, which is focusing on applying the state-of-art object detection algorithm SSD(Single-Shot-Detection)
                            to solve the object detection problems on high resolution images. The first version of this model was using the sliding window method combining
                            with SSD prediction model to do the detection, NMS(non-maximum suppression) algorithm was used to remove the replicate detection. The advanced version
                            was using the AZ-net(adjacency and zoom in net) to reduce the number of detections by SSD, which accelerate the detection processes by the model.

                            This research project was more about thinking. I worked with my friend Dajun Xu and PhD student Long Pham, supervised by Professor Kevin Chang.
                            In the first period of this project, I came up with the idea of the BitMap(using the grid system to get the embedding of a webpage). Then I implemented the part of
                            constructing the BitMap according to the data that Dajun got. Then I also wrote the scirpt for training using the Deep Learning framework Tensorflow. The thing that
                            we still do not finish is the dataset(usually for the model to train, we need at least thousand of labeled data). However, due to my
                            health problem, I did not continue this project in Spring 2017.

                            do semantic segmentation on medicine photos. In this project, I began my journey on researches, started to read paper
                            about the state-of-art technologies. I really appreciate Zengming for letting me working with him together.
                            Following the guidance of him, I watched the Stanford course cs231n(Convolutional Neural Network) which gave me a
                            good picture on how to start to learn deep learning. Also, during this project, I self-studied the deep learning
                            library Caffe. At the begining, I encounted many difficulties as Caffe was quite a large framework written in C++,
                            using many C++11/C++13 rules that I did not studied before. During the studying process, I could manage to understand
                            the source code of Caffe and used it as the tool to train the neural networks.

                            Splendor is a famour board game among the university students. As we played this game many times during the semester, we came up with the idea to implement it in Java.
                            This is totally a software project. The first version is the final project of CS242(Programming Studio) which is implemented in Java, in which I implemented
                             the game logic, game loop, networking as well as the replay mode. The work was splited into 4 weeks, and in each week we wrote the codes and the tests for our program.
                             After that, I deployed it into android, where I practiced my skill on writing the android layout code and also the controller of android activities and intents. After that, I also
                             re-implemented the game in Kotlin, which was the new language anounced to support android.

                            This is a script wroten in Python to predict the S&amp;P500 index of next day.
                            The prediction model is trained by the LSTM network in Keras on Tensorflow. The traning data is the close price of S&amp;P500 of each day,
                             and every 23 days form a group where the first 22 days are the parameters and the 23th price is the groundtruth for the prediction. For now the model
                              has a correctness of 80% on predicting the single day's change based on the previous 22 days' data. This is my first trial on using machine learning on finance,
                              as this is something really interested to me, I would try more different models and other hypo-parameters in the near future.

                            This is the course project of CS412(Data Mining), in which we implemented a javascript extension of Chrome to extract information from Youtube.
                            We implemented 3 different algorithms, including K-Means, Distant Comparing and Naive Bayes. Among these 3 methods, we found that the distance method and the Naive Bayes Model could give
                             better results. Also we add the function for extract the visual blocks highlightened by our model to csv files which could be used for analysis in future.
